			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to market and sell digital sourdough recipe books for each season of the year. It will also be to provide an introduction to sourdough baking.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Home bakers and cooking enthusiasts looking for seasonal recipes. Primarily those who enjoy baking with sourdough or those who would like to learn how to bake with sourdough.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I plan on using a search and filter function on the home page for the recipe books that will be held in a js array. I will use a form for users to input data and submit it with conditional logic so it is filled out properly. I will also use flex box layout and media queries for a responsive design.</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
